```{r load csv file}
homicides <- read.csv("./local/homicide-data.csv")
```

The raw data describes victim name, race, age, sex, location of homicide, and whether an arrest was made.

```{r}
homicides = homicides |> 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) |> 
  mutate(city_state = as.numeric(city_state)) |> 
  group_by(city_state) 

```

```{r count number of homicides}
homicides |> 
  summarize(count = n())
```

There are `r nrow(homicides)` homicides.

```{r}
homicides |> 
  filter(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest") |> 
  summarize(count = n())
```

There are `r homicides |> filter(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest") |> summarize(count = n()) |> pull(count)` unsolved homicides.
