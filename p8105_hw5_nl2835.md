``` r
homicides <- read.csv("./local/homicide-data.csv")
```

The raw data describes victim name, race, age, sex, location of
homicide, and whether an arrest was made.

``` r
homicides = homicides |> 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) |> 
  mutate(city_state = as.numeric(city_state)) |> 
  group_by(city_state) 
## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
## ℹ In argument: `city_state = as.numeric(city_state)`.
## Caused by warning:
## ! NAs introduced by coercion
```

``` r
homicides |> 
  summarize(count = n())
## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   city_state count
##        <dbl> <int>
## 1         NA 52179
```

There are 52179 homicides.

``` r
homicides |> 
  filter(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest") |> 
  summarize(count = n())
## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   city_state count
##        <dbl> <int>
## 1         NA 26505
